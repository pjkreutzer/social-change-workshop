Do you want to connect with like-minded people and researchers in the Lund region? Join us for a one-day workshop on May 6th, 2023 at the Auditorium SOL!\n\nOur aim is to create a space for collaboration, exchange, and experimentation. We want to hear from you, the activists and changemakers, about your experiences and ideas for creating a more sustainable future. Creating change in society is difficult and challenging, and we do not have all the answers. But we believe that we can learn from each other and find useful ideas, tools and inspiration in each of our experiences and backgrounds.\n\nThroughout the day, we will have various sessions where researchers will share their insights and facilitate discussions on different aspects of change. But don't worry, we aim to keep the sessions broad and accessible to everyone. This can mean short talks followed by discussions, hands-on activities like crafting messages and strategies, or exploring example cases.\n\nWe welcome up to 50 participants from social activist groups, universities, and the general public. Let's build bridges between researchers and activists, and be inspired by each other to create a more sustainable future!\n\nBelow you can find more information about the workshop, including the agenda, speakers, and how to register.\n\n\n| Start | End   | Session                                                                | With                       |\n|-------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 9:00  | 9:15  | Arrival & Check In                                                     |                            |\n| 9:15  | 10:00 | Keynote                                                                | Catia Gregoratti                         |\n| 10:00 | 10:45 | Fish Bowl Discussion                                                   | NGO, Scientist, You        |\n| 10:45 | 11:00 | Break                                                                  |                            |\n| 11:00 | 11:45 | Pro-environmental values: how to mold them into changing our behaviour | Georgeis Tsiakiris         |\n| 11:45 | 12:30 | Creative artivism in an authoritarian context                     | Cheryl Fung                |\n| 12:30 | 13:30 | Lunch                                                                  | -                          |\n| 13:30 | 14:15 | Building peace and caring for the planet â€“ an impossible utopia?                                                                    | Barbara Magalhaes Teixeira |\n| 14:15 | 15:00 | Strategies and tactics of convergence for climate justice              | Salvatore Paolo De Rosa    |\n| 15:15 | 15:30 | Wrap-up                                                                | -                          |\n\n## Location\n\n\nThe workshop will take place at the Auditorium SOL, located at the University of Lund.
